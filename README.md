# Jig - managing your hosts and VM's with one simple command

Jig is an attempt to simplfy the use of Docker machine and its drivers.

Its expected to be a drop in replacement for docker-machine, but to improve out ability to iterate on drivers and their use.

The first command I'm intending to add is `jig install` - to list, upgrade, download jig, docker-machine and drivers.
